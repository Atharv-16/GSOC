<img src="/images/ET.png" alt="Example Image" width="1100">

This repository contains code for training an Equivariant Transformer (ET) model with self-supervised training using DINO (DINOv2) for lensing image classification. The model is designed to classify lensing images into different classes of lensed galaxies. While the implementation is complete and the model is trainable, further adjustments are needed to fine-tune hyperparameters and optimize the training process. Contributions and improvements to the codebase are welcome.
